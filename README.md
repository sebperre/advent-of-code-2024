# Advent Of Code 2024

Welcome to my journey of solving the **Advent of Code 2024** using Python! This annual coding challenge was an excellent way to sharpen my programming skills, explore creative problem-solving, and enjoy the festive season with a global community of developers.

## Why Advent of Code?

Advent of Code provides a unique opportunity to:

1. **Practice Daily Problem Solving**: Each day comes with a new challenge, progressively increasing in complexity.
2. **Improve Python Skills**: Dive deep into Python features, libraries, and idiomatic practices.
3. **Collaborate and Learn**: Share solutions, discuss approaches, and collaborate with my friends.
4. **Celebrate Coding in December**: Combine the holiday spirit with the joy of coding.

## My Approach

### Tools and Setup

- **Language**: Python
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Environment**: WSL

### Structure

I organized my solutions by day. Each day has its dedicated folder (e.g., `day1`, `day2`) with the input and code.

## Reflection

Advent of Code 2024 has been a rewarding experience, enhancing my Python expertise and problem-solving abilities. The creative challenges pushed me to think critically and explore new techniques (Such as new graph algorithms and mathematical skills).
